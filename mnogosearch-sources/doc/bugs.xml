    <title>Core dump reports</title>
    <para>If &indexer; or &search.cgi;
    crashed and produced a core dump, it will be very helpful to
    send us a backtrace which can be created using <application>gdb</application> 
    (<application>The GNU Debugger</application>).
    Please follow through the following steps to create a backtrace.
    </para>

    <para>Run GNU Debugger with the executable as the first argument and with  core file as the second:</para>
    <para>
<userinput>
gdb indexer indexer.core
</userinput>
    </para>
    <para>Some information about crash will be displayed:
<programlisting>
Core was generated by `indexer'.
Program terminated with signal 8, Floating point exception.

Reading symbols from /usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1...done.
#0  0x80483f3 in main () at indexer.c:4
4               printf("%d",0/0);
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>Then type <literal>backtrace</literal> and press <literal>Enter</literal>.
    <programlisting>
(gdb) backtrace
#0  0x80483f3 in main () at indexer.c:4

</programlisting>
    </para>
    
    <para>
    Copy the backtrace output and paste it into bug report.
