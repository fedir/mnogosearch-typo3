  <para>
   Starting from version 3.2.16 &mnogo;
   does not support the so called cache mode anymore. Cache mode used its own
   storage engine to store the words index. It was in many cases faster
   than the SQL-based words index, but it was very buggy and unstable,
   and in fact it was almost impossible to use it in a serious production environment.
   The decision was made to stop supporting cache mode and to concentrate on improving
   the SQL-based modes.

  <para>
   Starting from version 3.2.36 &mnogo;
   supports <literal>DBMode=blob</literal> for both indexing and search. It is a replacement
   for the old cache mode, which is both fast and stable.
