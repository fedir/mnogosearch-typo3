How can I contribute to the project?
There are several ways you can help. Visit "Help us" page.

If I have pages with no keywords in the META description, will the document 
get indexed? 
Yes. By default mnoGoSearch does index whole document. 
By changing the default values you can give different weights to different 
parts of the document: body, title, keywords, description.

When searching words in spanish (accentuated characters) with search.cgi 
I get results like the following: If I search for "Espan~a", search.cgi 
breaks the word in two parts, searching  for "Espa" and also for "a",
ignoring "n~" (small Latin letter with tilde).

Have you set local charset to 8859-1? If not, do so in both 
indexer.conf and search.htm .

Why indexer fails with the message like indexer: can't load library 
'libmysqlclient.so.xxx'?  

Most likely MySQL libraries are not in the linker search path.
Find which directory libmysqlclient.so.xxx is installed into.
Then
- on Linux, add this directory into /etc/ld.so.conf,
  and run ldconfig as root.

- on FreeBSD, run ldconfig as a root, this way:
  ldconig -m /usr/local/lib/mysql/lib/

You can also set the value of environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH with
the path to required dynamic libraries. This works on any OS. 

Note that this is a general UNIX configuration issue, not only mnoGoSearch 
specific.

What is the maximum size of server(s) mnoGoSearch can run with?

Cache storage mode, introduced in 3.1.x, is able to index and search through 
several millions documents.

I want to index multiple virtual domains on a single box. What settings do I 
need to change for that? 

It is fully supported. No special settings are required.

Is it possible to use different templates for searches, i.e. view search 
results in the design of different sites without having to recompile 
search.cgi?  There are actually several ways to do it. They are given here 
in the order how search.cgi detects template name. 

search.cgi checks environment variable UDMSEARCH_TEMPLATE. Thus you can 
enter a path to desired search template into this variable. 

search.cgi also supports Apache internal redirect. It checks REDIRECT_STATUS 
and REDIRECT_URL environment variables. To activate this template option you 
may add these lines to Apache srm.conf: 

AddType text/html .zhtml
AddHandler zhtml .zhtml
Action zhtml /cgi-bin/search.cgi

Put search.cgi into your /cgi-bin/ directory. Then put HTML template into 
your site directory structure under any name with .zhtml extension, for 
example template.zhtml. Now you may open search page: 
http://www.site.com/path/to/template.zhtml 
Of course you may use any available extension instead of .zhtml. 

If the above two ways fail, search.cgi will open a template which has the 
same name with the script being executed using SCRIPT_NAME environment 
variable. search.cgi will open a template ETC/search.htm, search1.cgi will 
open ETC/search1.htm and so on, where ETC is mnoGoSearch /etc directory 
(usually /usr/local/mnogosearch/etc). So, you can use the same search.cgi 
with different templates without having to recompile it. Just create one or 
several hard or symbolic links for search.cgi or copy it under different 
names then put correspondent search templates into /etc directory of 
mnoGoSearch installation.
