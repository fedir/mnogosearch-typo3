This directory contains a test suite for mnogosearch indexer
and search.cgi. To run it, please 

1. Compile mnogosearch with some SQL database support.

2. Set UDM_TEST_DBADDR environment variable specifying the database
   you want to run tests with, in format the same with DBAddr
   indexer.conf command. 

   For example,

      export UDM_TEST_DBADDR=mysql://root@localhost/test/


   or

      export UDM_TEST_DBADDR=sqlite://localhost/home/bar/sqlite.db/
   
   
   You don't need to create tables, test program will do it itself.
   
   NOTE: all existing data will be lost in this database
   after running the tests. 


3. Run "make check"
