  Some HTTP servers can be configured to support multiple versions
  of the same document, written in different languages. The server
  decides which version of the document to send to the browser
  during so called <literal>HTTP content negotiation</literal>,
  according to the browser settings. For example,
  in case of <application>Firefox</application> Web browser,
  you can select your preferred language going to the
  <literal>Edit</literal> &gt; <literal>Preferences</literal> &gt;
  <literal>Content</literal> &gt; <literal>Languages</literal> menu.
  </para>

  <para>&mnogo; supports
  language negotiation with help of
  the <command><xref linkend="cmdref-varylang"/></command> command.
  This command specifies a space-separated list of the desired language codes.
  &indexer; will download and index all versions
  of the documents.
  </para>

  <para>Usage example:
<programlisting>
VaryLang "ru en fr"
</programlisting>
  <command>indexer</command> will fetch all document copies, written in Russian, English and French languages.
  </para>

  <note>
  <para>
  At search time you can limit &search.cgi; return
  only pages written in a certain language by passing using the <literal>g</literal>
  HTML form variable. Have a look into <xref linkend="search-params"/>
  for details.
